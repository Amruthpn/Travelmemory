.env file to work with the backend after creating a database in mongodb:

MONGO_URI='ENTER_YOUR_URL'
PORT=3001

--------

For frontend, you need to create .env file and put the following content (remember to change it based on your requirements):

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

When EC2 instance is used,, use public ip in place of localhost
